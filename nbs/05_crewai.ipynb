       "'Title: Continental acquires mold specialist EMT for commercial and specialty tires\\nAuthor: Christian Hinton\\nDate: 2024-05-02\\nDescription: With the acquisition of EMT, Continental said it can independently produce tire molds for all applications if required.\\nSite Name: Tire Review Magazine\\nURL: https://www.tirereview.com/continental-mold-specialist-acquisition/\\n---\\nContinental has acquired the mold manufacturing specialist EMT s.r.o. based in Púchov, Slovakia. All shares of Continental’s long-standing supplier were transferred to Continental effective April 2. The tire manufacturer had entered into a respective agreement with EMT’s shareholders, Dynamic Design (Romania) being the majority shareholder. All 107 employees, who have specialist knowledge in mold manufacturing, have been taken on by Continental, the company said. Further details of the agreement were not disclosed.\\nEMT is a manufacturer of special tire molds, especially for commercial vehicle and specialty tires. According to Continental, the company specializes in the milling of molds made of steel. With the acquisition of EMT, Continental said it completes its internal portfolio for mold making technologies. From now on, the tire manufacturer can independently produce tire molds for all applications if required. A first major step in this direction was the takeover of German mold manufacturer A-Z Formen in 2015 and Czech mold specialist VFC in 1993. Both companies specialize in producing molds for passenger car tires.\\n“With the acquisition of EMT, we can act completely independently in mold making if required. Having expertise for all mold applications in house is a strategic advantage, given the economic uncertainties worldwide,” Dr. Bernhard Trilken, head of production and logistics at Continental’s Tires group sector, said.\\nContinental said molds are used in tire construction as part of the vulcanization of tires. In this production step, raw rubber is converted into a flexible and elastic rubber. With the help of molds, a tire gets its desired stability and shape.\\n“We are excited about the technological reinforcement that the EMT team brings to the table. As a long-standing partner, the relationship with Continental is already close,” said Julia Sadrina, who is responsible for production of tire molds and machinery worldwide for Continental’s tire business.\\nContinental said it consistently invests in the digitalization and automation of its global manufacturing operations at its 20 tire plants in 16 countries worldwide. The company said the focus lies on research and development of technologies, alternative materials, environmentally friendly production as well continuous improvements of the overall efficiency of logistics processes. By 2050 at the latest, the tire manufacturer said it aims to achieve 100% climate neutrality along its entire value chain.'"

      "MLS Rivalry Week presented by Continental Tire continues this week with another slate of marquee rivalry matchups across the country. Midweek action sees the Lionel Messi-led Inter Miami CF travel to Orlando City SC looking to claim two wins over their in-state rivals for the first time since 2020. Rivalry Week will conclude this weekend with three intense battles, kicking off with New York City FC vs. New York Red Bulls and Toronto FC vs. CF MontrÃ©al at 7:30 p.m. ET followed by the Colorado Rapids taking on Real Salt Lake at 9:30 p.m. ET.\n",
      "Inter Miami CF made a statement in their 5-0 win over in-state rival Orlando City SC earlier this season, and the club will look to do the same as they travel to Orlandoâs INTER&Co Stadium on Wednesday with the hopes of extending their five-game winning streak.\n",
      "This match will be seasoned in South American flair on both sides. The dynamic duo of Lionel Messi and Luis SuÃ¡rez continues to find the back of the net for Miami, with SuÃ¡rez tied atop the MLS Golden Boot presented by Audi standings with 11 goals in his first MLS season. Recently acquired Paraguayan midfielder MatÃas Rojasâ blistering start to his MLS career, scoring three goals in three games, and Argentinian-American Benjamin Cremaschiâs return to Miamiâs midfield have been instrumental to the clubâs current unbeaten run.\n",
      "Orlando, though, have never lost to Miami at home and the pressure will be on the clubâs contingent of South Americans to keep that run alive. Colombian forward Luis Muriel got off the mark last time out with two goals against the Philadelphia Union and Nico Lodeiro recorded a hat trick of assists as he set up each of Orlandoâs three goals last weekend. Among the clubâs domestic talent, U.S. Olympic hopeful Duncan McGuire leads Orlando with five goals on the season with sights set on adding more against the stars of Miami as he looks to outshine Messi.\n",

      "For the Red Bulls, midfielder Daniel Edelman (21) and defender John Tolkin (21) have earned international recognition for their success in MLS with call-ups for the United States Menâs Olympic roster team. Frankie Amaya (23), a former No. 1 overall draft pick, has played over 1,900 minutes in each of his previous two seasons and continues to be a driving force in midfield.

      "Qualcomm teams with automotive firm to implement a cross-domain high-performance computer in a car based on cloud-based Automotive Edge Framework and Snapdragon system-on-chip\n",
      "In what is described as a first-of-its-kind deployment, hosting vehicle functions such as driving safety and automated parking, and offering real-life proof of the capabilities of a software-defined vehicle (SDV), Continental Automotive has implemented a cross-domain high-performance computer (HPC) in a car.\n",
      "Said to serve as a showcase for what the development of SDVs can look like for automotive engineers, the car uses the automotive firm’s cloud-based Continental Automotive Edge Framework (CAEdge). The Continental SDV technology includes automated parking functions with holistic motion control, ultrasonic sensors, an integrated brake system and surround view cameras, all within a cross-domain HPC.\n",
      "Continental’s cloud-based development platform for the SDV is designed to connect the vehicle to the cloud and features a virtual workbench to simplify and accelerate the development, supply and maintenance of software-intensive system functions. This offers automotive software engineers the opportunity to test software on a virtual HPC before deploying it on the physical hardware and to fix software-related issues by debugging software directly in the cloud.\n",
      "Using its SDV technology show car (pictured above), Continental said it can prove speed, development productivity and customer-oriented thinking for a competitive advantage when customers are seeking to reduce time to market by deploying software functions from a virtual HPC into a production vehicle.\n",
      "“With the SDV technology car, we are able to demonstrate Continental’s ecosystem: from road to cloud, from virtual to real,” said Gilles Mabire, chief technology officer at Continental Automotive. “As the first development partner for vehicle manufacturers in the world, we are proud of how we have moved beyond concepts and can showcase the capabilities and challenges of the convergence of automotive domains in a tangible software-defined vehicle.”\n",
      "Gilles Mabire, Continental Automotive\n",
      "Jean-François Tarabbia, head of business area architecture and networking at Continental Automotive, said: “The goal is not only to show how well functions work, but to validate how well multiple technologies can be integrated and work alongside each other in HPC-based vehicle architectures within a software-defined vehicle.\n",
      "“This is a crucial step to convince the market that the goal to combine several control units in one HPC is not just feasible, but can also render the cost benefits we want to achieve. The concept of the software-defined vehicle relies heavily on high-performance hardware that can handle the [large] amount of data.”\n",
      "The implementation was based on the Snapdragon Ride Flex System-on-Chip (SoC) with pre-integrated Snapdragon Ride Vision perception stack from Qualcomm Technologies to integrate cockpit and additional functions in one HPC-based vehicle architecture. The Flex Soc is designed to provide a more integrated and adaptable approach to designing and developing vehicle architecture, supporting multi-critical workloads on a single chip.\n",
      "This is said to allow automakers and suppliers to optimise their cost, power and performance, and accelerate their time-to-market advantage and embrace an adaptable approach to designing their vehicles. Passengers are said to benefit from an enhanced driving experience characterised by added assistance, safety and comfort.\n",

      "Continental has unveiled its latest innovation in bicycle tire technology: the ContiTube TPU Tubes. These tubes are designed to be an ultralight, high-performance option for cyclists looking for a competitive edge. Weighing in at just 35 grams, the ContiTube TPU Tubes are significantly lighter than traditional butyl rubber tubes, which typically weigh between 100 and 200 grams.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new tubes are made from thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), a material known for its durability and elasticity. According to Continental, TPU offers several advantages over butyl rubber, including better puncture resistance and lower rolling resistance. This means that cyclists can expect a smoother, faster ride with less effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the standout features of the ContiTube TPU Tubes is their compact size when deflated. Cyclists who carry spare tubes will appreciate the fact that these tubes take up much less space in a saddlebag or jersey pocket. Additionally, the TPU material is recyclable, making the ContiTube TPU Tubes an environmentally friendly choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Continental is marketing the new tubes to both professional racers and amateur enthusiasts. The company has a long history of innovation in the cycling industry, and the ContiTube TPU Tubes are a continuation of that legacy. With their combination of light weight, durability, and performance, these tubes are poised to become a popular choice among cyclists.\n",
